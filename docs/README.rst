Documentation
=============

Sphinx is required to build the documentation. To install it, run ``pip install sphinx``.

To build the documentation as HTML::

    $ cd docs/
    $ make html

The resulting HTML will be in the "_builds" directory.

To build the documentation as PDF::

    $ cd docs/
    $ make latexpdf

This, of course, will require LaTeX to be installed.
